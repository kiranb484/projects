# About
This script will take image snapshots of the screen continuously and uses it as background image.
- The block will continuously move and change its color.
- It has 2 surfaces.
    * Base surface will have black color.
    * Main surface will change its color continuously.
    * Main surface side will be less than the base surface. Giving the illusion of having a border around the block.
